* background scrolls diagonally a little
* title screen
  - Have both layers scroll identically on title screen to make it look like we have transparancy ;)
  - add a title
* sfx, music
  - use responsibility (louder square) as the ingame tune
  - All by myself would be a good results screen tune. Maybe also title
  - Don't forget to change the sfx driver to avoid pcm2
* less time in later levels, monster faster, more bombs
* result screen
* display maze number somewhere
* remove dbg garbage
