* background scrolls diagonally a little
* Have both layers scroll identically on title screen to make it look like we have transparancy ;)
* use responsibility (louder square) as the ingame tune. Don't forget to change the sfx driver to avoid pcm2
* sfx, other music
* less time in later levels, monster faster, more bombs
* result screen
* display maze number somewhere
