* background scrolls diagonally a little
* Have both layers scroll identically on title screen to make it look like we have transparancy ;)
* score
* game over if you're too slow clearing a maze
* balls explode the walls that they touch, so maze is more and more exposed as we go
* use responsibility (louder square) as the ingame tune. Don't forget to change the sfx driver to avoid pcm2
* sfx
* less time in later levels
